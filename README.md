# Silent CSV File Reading Error in R

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in R: silent failure when attempting to read a CSV file that doesn't exist or is improperly formatted.  The provided code lacks robust error handling, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially difficult-to-debug issues.

## Problem
The `bug.r` file shows how a simple `read.csv` call can fail without throwing an obvious error. The error handling is inadequate, allowing the code to continue execution even when the file is not found or is malformed.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.r` file presents an improved version with more robust error handling. It uses `tryCatch` to explicitly catch errors and provide informative messages.  This allows for better debugging and prevents unexpected results.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.r` and `bugSolution.r` in your R environment.
3. Run the code in `bug.r` to see the silent failure.  Note that if `my_file.csv` doesn't exist, the code will continue to run without warning.
4. Run the code in `bugSolution.r` to observe the improved error handling.
